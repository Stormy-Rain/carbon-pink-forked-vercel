>A [[Races/Gobbo\|Gobbo]] squares off against her larger opponents, her massive cyber-fists each nearly the size of her torso. She bounces from foot to foot before springing forward, her superior speed and strength sending them reeling in surprise.

>Taking a deep breath, an [[Elf\|Elf]] covered in circuitry tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the [[gangbangers\|gangbangers]] charge her, she lets her [[internal implants turn her exhalation into white-hot plasma that washes over her foes\|internal implants turn her exhalation into white-hot plasma that washes over her foes]].

>Moving in utter silence, a black-clad [[Wukong\|Wukong]] crawls along the outside of a [[corp\|corp]] exec’s [[penthouse\|penthouse]]. He pauses on the balcony outside the [[kleptocrat’s\|kleptocrat’s]] bedroom, pulling a [[knife\|knife]] from its sheath as he contemplates how vulnerable people are while they sleep.

Whatever their style or specialty, [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)\|Brawler]] are united in their ability to turn their own bodies into lethal weapons. They train relentlessly to become the ultimate martial artists, combining physical and mental discipline with cybernetic augmentation on the road to perfection.

#### The Power of CHI
No mere street fighters or pugilists, [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)\|Brawlers]] are heirs to special combat techniques fueled by a unique implant: the Cerebral Haste Insert. This cybernetic tool allows [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)\|Brawlers]] to overcome their normal limitations, overclocking brain and body to perform superhuman feats of strength, speed, and skill. The CHI implant is so thoroughly wired into a [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)\|Brawler’s]] brain and nervous system that it can never be removed; indeed, many [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)\|Brawler]] groups attract new members by offering to teach secrets that unlock the implant’s potential even further.

[[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)\|Brawlers]] harness the power of CHI to channel uncanny strength and speed into their strikes, as well as allowing them to disrupt the nervous systems of their enemies, produce reality-warping fields, and otherwise do the seemingly impossible. As they gain experience, their martial training and mastery of the energy from their CHI implant gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.

#### Unity and Independence
[[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)\|Brawlers]] tend to gather into tight-knit gangs known as “clans,” building refuges and communes outside the grip of corporate-controlled life. The [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)\|Brawlers]] who join a clan seek personal perfection through practice, rigorous training, and techniques designed to unlock the CHI implant’s potential. While some clans seclude themselves from outsiders entirely, others act as protectors of their neighborhood or local warlords, using their mastery of combat skills to keep the [[corpos\|corpos]] out.

For a [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)\|Brawler]], becoming a [[freelancer\|freelancer]] means leaving their clan behind, at least temporarily. Some clans regard this as a horrific betrayal of their teachings, while most see it as a learning opportunity or a chance for the novice [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)\|Brawler]] to bring back resources and connections for the clan’s benefit.

{ #2aafbb}


You gain the following benefits while you are [[unarmed\|unarmed]] or wielding only [[brawler weapons\|brawler weapons]] and you aren’t wearing [[Equipment/Armor\|armor]] or wielding a [[shield\|shield]]:
 - You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your [[unarmed strikes\|unarmed strikes]] and [[brawler weapons\|brawler weapons]].
 - You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your [[unarmed strike\|unarmed strike]] or [[brawler weapon\|brawler weapon]]. This die changes as you gain [[brawler\|brawler]] levels, as shown in the [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)#Brawler Table\|Martial Arts column of the Brawler table]].
 - When you use the Attack action with an [[unarmed strike\|unarmed strike]] or a [[brawler weapon\|brawler weapon]] on your turn, you can make one [[unarmed strike\|unarmed strike]] as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a [[baton\|baton]], you can also make an [[unarmed strike\|unarmed strike]] as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.



#### Unarmored Defense
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no [[Equipment/Armor\|armor]] and not wielding a [[shield\|shield]], your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.

#### Unarmored Movement
Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing [[Equipment/Armor\|armor]] or wielding a [[shield\|shield]]. This bonus increases when you reach certain [[brawler\|brawler]] levels, as shown in the [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)#Brawler Table\|Brawler table]].

#### Weapon Training
As you refine your [[martial arts style\|martial arts style]], you train yourself to use a variety of [[Equipment/Weapons\|weapons]] as [[brawler weapons\|brawler weapons]]. During a short or long rest, you can briefly practice with a [[weapon\|weapon]] to count it as a [[brawler weapon\|brawler weapon]] until you use this feature again. The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:
- The [[weapon\|weapon]] must be a [[civilian\|civilian]] or [[military weapon\|military weapon]].
- You must be proficient with it.
- It must lack the heavy and special properties.

#### Brawler Clan
When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a [[brawler\|brawler]] tradition known as a clan. Your clan grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

#### Deflect Missiles
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect the projectile when you are hit by a ranged attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your [[brawler\|brawler]] level. You can only use this ability against mundane, muscle-powered attacks, such as thrown [[knives\|knives]], [[slingshots\|slingshots]], and [[archery\|archery]] attacks.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

You can forgo taking this feature to take a [[feat\|feat]] of your choice instead.

#### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Empowered Strikes
Starting at 6th level, your [[unarmed strikes\|unarmed strikes]] count as [[tech\|tech]] for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to mundane attacks and damage.

#### Evasion
At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a [[grenade’s\|grenade’s]] blast radius. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

#### Iron Will
Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

#### Parkour
At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

#### Iron Body
At 10th level, your mastery of your own metabolism makes you immune to disease and poison.

#### Parry Bullets
Starting at 13th level, your ability to [[deflect missiles\|deflect missiles]] is improved, allowing you to also deflect bullets and tech-enhanced projectiles (but not pure [[tech\|tech]] attacks, like [[micro seeker\|micro seeker]]). To deflect such high-powered projectiles, you must be armed with a [[brawler melee weapon\|brawler melee weapon]].

#### CHI
Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the overclocking ability of your [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)#CHI\|Cerebral Haste Insert (CHI)]] implant. Your access to this implant is represented by a number of [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)#CHI\|CHI points]]. Your brawler level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)#Brawler Table\|CHI Points column of the Brawler table]].

You can spend these points to fuel various [[CHI features\|CHI features]]. You start knowing three such features: [[Flurry Attack\|Flurry Attack]], [[Patient Defense\|Patient Defense]], and [[Overclock Rush\|Overclock Rush]]. You learn more [[CHI features\|CHI features]] as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)#CHI\|CHI points]], it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)#CHI\|CHI]] back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)#CHI\|CHI points]].

Some of your [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)#CHI features\|CHI features]] require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
> - [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)#CHI\|CHI]] save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

In addition, you no longer need food or water, directly absorbing life-sustaining energy from your [[Classes/Brawler/Brawler (Monk)#CHI\|CHI implant]].

> [!info] Ghost in the Machine

>
