## “While you were partying, I was studying the blade!”

  
Few martial disciplines have as storied and ancient a history as that of the Otaku Clan. These martial artists train extensively with their preferred weapons, emulating the fighting techniques they have discerned through their obsessive fixation on the Old World writings and videos known as “manga” and “anime.” These depictions of warriors with superhuman skill inspire members of the Otaku Clan to ever-greater heights of devotion, hoping to eventually unlock the greatest abilities possessed by their heroic icons.

Path of the Otaku

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons. This path also includes instruction in the traditional and refined art of manga. You gain the following benefits:

Otaku Weapons. Choose two types of weapons to be your otaku weapons: one melee weapon and one ranged weapon. Each of these weapons can be any civilian or military weapon that lacks the heavy and special properties. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don’t already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are brawler weapons for you. Many of this tradition’s features work only with your otaku weapons. When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon—either melee or ranged—to be an otaku weapon for you, following the criteria above.

Agile Parry. If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding an otaku melee weapon, you can use it to defend yourself. You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren’t incapacitated.

Gun Fu. You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with an otaku weapon more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using an otaku weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon’s type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.

Art Weeb. You gain proficiency with artist's supplies.

One with the Blade

At 6th level, you extend your CHI implant’s energy into your otaku weapons, granting you the following benefits.

Tech Weapons. Your attacks with your otaku weapons count as tech-powered for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to mundane attacks and damage.

Deft Strike. When you hit a target with an otaku weapon, you can spend 1 CHI point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

Study the Blade

At 11th level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons further with your CHI energy. As a bonus action, you can expend up to 3 CHI points to grant one otaku weapon you hold a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The bonus equals the number of CHI points you spent. This bonus lasts for 1 minute, until you drop the weapon, or until you use this feature again. This feature has no effect on a tech weapon that already has a bonus to attack and damage rolls.

Unerring Accuracy

At 17th level, your mastery of weapons grants you extraordinary accuracy. If you miss with an attack roll using an otaku weapon on your turn, you can reroll it. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.
