## “The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he didn’t exist.”

  
The Sunset Clan does not exist—at least not officially. Everyone in the underground world of martial arts and freelance mercenaries has heard of them, of course, but they would all be hard-pressed to say anything certain or definitive about them. What little is known paints the Sunset Clan as a shadowy cabal of brawlers who sell their talents to the highest bidder, corporate or rebel alike, and who recruit new members in secret. They avoid scrutiny as much as possible, clinging to the shadows that are their natural habitat, striking from the darkness and fading away.

Shadow Arts

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can use your CHI implant to duplicate the effects of certain techs. As an action, you can spend 2 CHI points to cast darkness, darkvision, pass without trace, or silence, without requiring a tech focus. Additionally, you gain the hardlight chicanery trick if you don’t already know it.

Shadow Warp

At 6th level, you gain the ability to teleport short distances, but only while unobserved. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.

Shadow Cloak

By 11th level, you have learned to become one with the darkness. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a tech, or enter an area of bright light.

Opportunist

At 17th level, you can exploit a creature’s momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.
