 ## “I’m not as think as you drunk I am.”

  
Drunken Fist clan holdings rarely look much like martial arts dojos. More often, they look like rough-and-tumble bars—the kind where drug dealers hang out in the back and they rent upstairs rooms by the hour. Anyone who tries to start unwanted trouble in them quickly discovers that the supposedly inebriated clientele are also highly proficient fighters. Drunken Fist brawlers are masters of appearing harmless, but their heavy drinking acts as a means of deregulating the safety limiters on their CHI implant, allowing them to fight at a high level despite having a blood alcohol content that would make a breathalyzer explode.

Bonus Proficiencies

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don’t already have it. Your martial arts technique mixes combat training with the precision of a dancer and the antics of a jester. You also gain proficiency with microbrewer’s tools if you don’t already have it.

Drunken Technique

At 3rd level, you learn how to twist and turn quickly as part of your Flurry Attack. Whenever you use Flurry Attack, you gain the benefit of the Disengage action, and your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the current turn.

Tipsy Sway

Starting at 6th level, you can move in sudden, swaying ways. You gain the following benefits.

Kip Up. When you’re prone, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.

Redirect Attack. When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can spend 1 CHI point as a reaction to cause that attack to hit one creature of your choice, other than the attacker, that you can see within 5 feet of you.

Drunkard’s Luck

Starting at 11th level, you always seem to get a lucky bounce at the right moment. When you make an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw and have disadvantage, you can spend 2 CHI points to cancel the disadvantage for that roll.

Intoxicated Frenzy

At 17th level, you gain the ability to make an overwhelming number of attacks against a group of enemies. When you use your Flurry Attack, you can make up to three additional attacks with it (up to a total of five additional attacks), provided that each Flurry Attack targets a different creature this turn.
