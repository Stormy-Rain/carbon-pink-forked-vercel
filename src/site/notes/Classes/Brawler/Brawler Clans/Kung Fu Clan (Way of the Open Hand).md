## "Woah."

  
When people talk about brawlers, it is almost inevitably members of the Kung Fu Clan they’re thinking about. This clan has extensive clan meeting halls, known as dojos, where they can gather to practice their skills, share gossip, and settle grudges between rival clan groups. They’re highly visible in both the mega-cities and the undercity, where they actively recruit new members to grow their ranks and spread their techniques. They have a reputation for being dismissive of “lesser techniques,” which serves to fuel their rivalry with other brawler clans.

Open Hand Technique

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy’s life force when you harness your CHI implant’s energy. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry Attack, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:

· It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

· It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.

· It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.

Rapid Regeneration

At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself by infusing your blood with nanites released from your CHI implant. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your brawler level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

Technical Pacifist

Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that disrupts the violent impulses of those around you. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a target disruptor spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Kill Switch

At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body, effectively poisoning their implants with a kill switch you can activate at will. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 CHI points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your brawler level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 entropic damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.
