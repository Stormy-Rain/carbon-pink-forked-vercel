 ## “You can be a king or a street sweeper, but everyone dances with the Grim Reaper.”

  
Brawlers of the Clan of the Reaper are only interested in one thing: death. Whether it be their own or someone else’s, Reaper brawlers are morbidly introspective about the cessation of life. They decorate themselves with emblems of death, from sugar-skull makeup to bone tattoos or even more extreme mortifications of the flesh. Their martial techniques focus on disrupting the life force in other creatures, culminating in a deceptively gentle strike that can kill with a single blow.

Reaper’s Call

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your study of death allows you to extract vitality from another creature as it nears its demise. When you reduce a creature within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your brawler level (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).

Reaper’s Shadow

At 6th level, you gain the ability to unsettle or terrify those around you as an action. When you take this action, each creature within 30 feet of you that can see you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

Reaper’s Friend

Beginning at 11th level, you use your familiarity with death to escape its grasp. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 CHI point (no action required) to have 1 hit point instead.

Reaper’s Touch

Starting at 17th level, your touch can channel pure entropic force into a creature. As an action, you touch one creature within 5 feet of you, and you expend 1 to 10 CHI points. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, and it takes 2d10 entropic damage per CHI point spent on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
