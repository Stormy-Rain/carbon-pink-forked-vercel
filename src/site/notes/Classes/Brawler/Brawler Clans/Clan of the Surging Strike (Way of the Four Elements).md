## “The laws of thermodynamics cannot be broken—but they are amenable to a bit of bending.”

  
One of the strangest elements of modern technology is the usage of gravitic fields to rapidly shift matter between its five possible states—gaseous, liquid, solid, plasma, and phased. These rapid matter shifts, colloquially known as “surges,” allow tech to generate intense heat and cold, condense liquids from the air, and seemingly create solid objects from nothing. The Clan of the Surging Strike has mastered methods of allowing their CHI implant to manipulate surgetech, effectively permitting them to manipulate the state of matter by punching it real hard.

Surge Disciple

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn disciplines that harness the power of the four states of matter. A discipline requires you to spend CHI points each time you use it.

You know the Surge Attunement discipline and one other surge discipline of your choice. You learn one additional surge discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

Whenever you learn a new surge discipline, you can also replace one surge discipline that you already know with a different discipline.

Casting Surge Tech. Some surge disciplines allow you to cast techs. To cast one of these techs, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don’t need to provide materials or a tech focus for it.

Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional CHI points to increase the level of a surge discipline tech that you cast, provided that the tech has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as flame vent does. The tech’s level increases by 1 for each additional CHI point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level brawler and use Plasma Jet to cast flame vent, you can spend 3 CHI points to cast it as a 2nd-level tech (the discipline’s base cost of 2 CHI points plus 1).

The maximum number of CHI points you can spend to cast a tech in this way (including its base CHI point cost and any additional CHI points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your brawler level, as shown in the Techs and CHI points table.

Surge Attunement

You can use your action to briefly control the state of matter within 30 feet of you, causing one of the following effects of your choice:

· Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect related to matter state changes such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, a spray of light mist, or a gentle rumbling of stone.

· Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small bonfire.

· Chill or warm up to 1 pound of nonliving material for up to 1 hour.

· Cause earth, fire, water, or mist that can fit within a 1-foot cube to shape itself into a crude form you designate for 1 minute.

Aerial Step

Prerequisite: 11th Level

You can spend 4 CHI points to cast flight, targeting yourself.

Aqueous Manipulation

As an action, you can spend 1 CHI point to choose an area of ice or water no larger than 30 feet on a side within 120 feet of you. You can change water to ice within the area and vice versa, and you can reshape ice in the area in any manner you choose. You can raise or lower the ice’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. For example, if you affect a 30-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 15 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 15 feet, dig a trench up to 15 feet deep, and so on. You can’t shape the ice to trap or injure a creature in the area.

Aqueous Whip

You can spend 2 CHI points as an action to create a whip of water that shoves and pulls a creature to unbalance it. A creature that you can see that is within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage, plus an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each additional CHI point you spend, and you can either knock it prone or pull it up to 25 feet closer to you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don’t pull it or knock it prone.

Cyclone Strike

You can create a blast of compressed air that strikes like a mighty fist. As an action, you can spend 2 CHI points and choose a creature within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage, plus an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each additional CHI point you spend, and you can push the creature up to 20 feet away from you and knock it prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don’t push it or knock it prone.

Plasma Cutter

When you use the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 CHI point to cause tendrils of flame to stretch out from your fists and feet. Your reach with your unarmed strikes increases by 10 feet for that action, as well as the rest of the turn. A hit with such an attack deals fire damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and if you spend 1 CHI point when the attack hits, it also deals an extra 1d10 fire damage.
