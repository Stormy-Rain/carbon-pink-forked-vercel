## “Dance ‘til you’re dead! Off with his head! Heads will roll, heads will roll, on the floor!”

  
Members of the Rave Clan are probably the least likely people you would expect to be deadly martial artists. Their “dojos” are temporary havens where they throw massive parties and drug-fueled orgies, and their “sparring” looks an awful lot like freestyle dancing. Still, their dance-inspired combat moves and pulse-pounding beats hide a surprising skill at combat. Their deadliest techniques involve using their CHI implant to focus radiant power through their bodies, emitting light as killing beams and dazzling auras.

Bonus Proficiencies

At 3rd level, you become proficient in the Performance skill and with one electronic musical instrument of your choice.

Rainbow Blast

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can hurl searing bolts of multi-hued brilliance.

You gain a new attack option that you can use with the Attack action. This special attack is a ranged tech attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is neon, and its damage die is a d4. This die changes as you gain brawler levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Brawler table.

When you take the Attack action on your turn and use this special attack as part of it, you can spend 1 CHI point to make the special attack twice as a bonus action.

When you gain the Extra Attack feature, this special attack can be used for any of the attacks you make as part of the Attack action.

Searing Blast

At 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your CHI into searing waves of energy. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 CHI points to cast the flame vent tech as a bonus action.

You can spend additional CHI points to cast flame vent as a higher level spell. Each additional CHI point you spend increases the spell’s level by 1. The maximum number of CHI points (2 plus any additional points) that you can spend on the spell equals half your brawler level.

Neon Plasma Burst

At 11th level, you gain the ability to create an orb of hardlight that erupts into a devastating explosion. As an action, you create the orb and hurl it at a point you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant energy for a brief but deadly instant.

Each creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 neon damage. A creature doesn’t need to make the save if the creature is behind total cover that is opaque.

You can increase the sphere’s damage by spending CHI points. Each point you spend, up to a maximum of 3, increases the damage by 2d6.

Neon Shield

At 17th level, you become wreathed in a luminous, rainbow-colored aura. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action.

If a creature hits you with a melee attack while this light shines, you can use your reaction to deal neon damage to the creature. The radiant damage equals 5 + your Wisdom modifier.
