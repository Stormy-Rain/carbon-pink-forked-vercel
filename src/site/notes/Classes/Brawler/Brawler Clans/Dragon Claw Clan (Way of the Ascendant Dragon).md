 ## “My skin is armor, my fists swords, and my battle cry a hurricane! Who can stand against the dragon and live?”

  
Brawler clans range wildly between serious martial artists and hedonistic (if disciplined) fist-fighters. Members of the Dragon Claw Clan are among the most serious of them all, approaching their fighting skills as a nearly religious practice. They emulate the dragons of myth and legend, seeking to become paragons of self-control, icons of quiet terror, and warriors of unparalleled power. Their stoic and carefully controlled demeanor hides an undercurrent of incredible violence, ready to burst forth at a moment’s notice. Their CHI implant techniques are all designed to make them more like the dragons they revere, an aesthetic impulse carried to a lethal extent.

Draconic Disciple

At 3rd level, you learn how to emulate the mythical dragons of ancient legends, using your implants to inflict deadly attacks and your stoic demeanor to overpower others through sheer force of personality. You gain the following benefits:

Dragon Claw. Your unarmed strikes can deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage if you wish.

Dragon Glare. If you fail a Charisma (Intimidation) or Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can use your reaction to reroll the check. Once this feature turns a failure into a success, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

Dragon Strike. When you damage a target with an unarmed strike, you can change the damage type to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.

Dragon’s Breath

At 3rd level you can channel destructive waves of energy, like those created by the dragons you emulate. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with an exhalation of draconic energy in either a 20-foot cone or a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice). Choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your CHI save DC, taking damage of the chosen type equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

At 11th level, the damage of this feature increases to three rolls of your Martial Arts die.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses available, you can spend 2 CHI points to use this feature again.

Wings Unfurled

At 6th level when you use your Overclock Rush, you can generate hardlight wings from your back that vanish at the end of your turn. While the wings exist, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Dragon Spirit

At 11th level the power of your stoic discipline now radiates from you, warding your allies or inspiring fear in your enemies. As a bonus action, you can create an aura of power that radiates 10 feet from you for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain one of the following effects of your choice:

· Frightful Presence. When you create this aura, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can choose a creature within the aura. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your CHI save DC or become frightened of you for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

· Resistance. Choose a damage type when you activate this aura: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You and your allies within the aura have resistance to that damage.

Once you create this aura, you can’t create it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 3 CHI points to create it again.

Ascendant Spirit

At 17th level, your draconic spirit reaches its peak. You gain the following benefits:

Augment Breath. When you use your Dragon’s Breath, you can spend 1 CHI point to augment its shape and power. The exhalation of draconic energy becomes either a 60-foot cone or a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice), and each creature in that area takes damage equal to four rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Blindsight. You gain blindsight out to 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if you’re blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

Explosive Fury. When you activate your Dragon Spirit, repressed fury explodes from you as excess power. Choose any number of creatures you can see in your aura. Each of those creatures must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your CHI save DC or take 3d10 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice).
