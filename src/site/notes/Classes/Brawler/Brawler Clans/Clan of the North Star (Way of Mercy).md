## “You are already dead!”

Equal parts merciful healers and merciless killers, the Clan of the North Star are a study in contradictions. Their clan’s martial art focuses on the use of their CHI implant to understand the flows of energy in themselves and others, turning them into masterful physicians but also granting them the power to kill with a touch. They can utterly disrupt an opponent’s life force through carefully placed pressure points, or beat the reaper at his own game. This dichotomy makes them a clan that is widely respected as both people who will beat your ass if you step out of line and people who will stitch you back together if you need it.

Implements of Mercy

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Insight and Medicine skills, and you gain proficiency with first aid kits.

Hands of Healing

At 3rd level, your touch can mend wounds. As an action, you can spend 1 CHI point to touch a creature and restore a number of hit points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.

When you use your Flurry Attack, you can replace one of the unarmed strikes with a use of this feature without spending a CHI point for the healing.

Hands of Harm

At 3rd level, you use your CHI to inflict wounds. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 CHI point to deal extra entropic damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this feature only once per turn.

Physician’s Touch

Starting at 6th level, you can administer even greater cures with a touch—and if you feel it’s necessary, you can use your knowledge to cause immense harm.

When you use Hands of Healing on a creature, you can also end one disease or one of the following conditions affecting the creature: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned.

When you use Hands of Harm on a creature, you can subject that creature to the poisoned condition until the end of your next turn.

Flurry of Healing and Harm

Starting at 11th level, you can now mete out a flurry of comfort and hurt. When you use Flurry Attack, you can now replace each of the unarmed strikes with a use of your Hands of Healing, without spending CHI points for the healing.

In addition, when you make an unarmed strike with Flurry Attack, you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without spending the CHI point for Hands of Harm. You can still use Hands of Harm only once per turn.

Hand of Ultimate Mercy

By 17th level, your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As an action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours and expend 5 CHI points. The creature then returns to life, regaining a number of hit points equal to 4d10 + your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died while subject to any of the following conditions, it revives with them removed: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
