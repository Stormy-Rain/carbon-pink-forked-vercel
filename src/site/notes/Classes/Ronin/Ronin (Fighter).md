>A [[Races/Human\|Human]] in stolen sec-force armor holds her [[Shield\|Shield]] before her as she charges the corpo bastards that showed up to bust the protest. An [[Elf\|Elf]] in fetish leather behind her peppers the massed security forces with bullets from a rifle painted hot pink. The [[Artificiate\|Artificiate]] nearby runs calculations on the best use of their allies’ force, feeding trajectories and tactical advice to them through their earpieces.

>A [[Jerboan\|Jerboan]] in riot armor interposes his [[Shield\|Shield]] between a titan’s massive steel girder club and his companions, deflecting the deadly blow. His companion, a [[Wukong\|Wukong]] armed with twin machetes, launches from the ground, scampering across the massive foe to seek a weak spot in its defenses.

>A [[Nayaling\|Nayaling]] smiles at the hovering camera drone, waving to their adoring fans before spitting out a mouthful of blood. They circle for advantage, trying to get on the knife-wielding hobo’s blind side. The hobo offers no such niceties, though, screaming in meth-induced rage before charging.

All of these characters are [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)\|Ronin (Fighter)]], warriors who rely on their skill, strategic ability, and tactical acumen to overcome challenges. Though they are all very different, they all share an unparalleled mastery of [[Equipment/Weapons\|Weapons]] and [[Equipment/Armor\|Armor]], and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)\|Ronin (Fighter)]] are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.

#### Battle-Hardened Specialists

[[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)\|Ronin (Fighter)]] learn the basics of all combat styles. Every [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)\|Ronin (Fighter)]] can pick up a sword, shoot a gun, and wear the heaviest of armor with competence. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)\|Ronin (Fighter)]] specializes in a certain style of combat. Some harry foes from afar with guns, some focus on fighting with two weapons at once, some augment their martial skill with tech, and some just beat people’s faces in with the biggest club they can find. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)\|Ronin (Fighter)]] superior combatants regardless of where they might find themselves fighting.

#### Trained for Danger

Any idiot can pick up a gun and make it go bang, but hardly any of them are [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)\|Ronin (Fighter)]]. The vast majority of corporate security forces, gangbangers, and wasteland warriors are relatively untrained combatants with only the most basic sort of battle skills. Corporate security officers, highly-trained bodyguards, and similar individuals are more likely to be [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)\|Ronin (Fighter)]].

Some [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)\|Ronin (Fighter)]] wind up on the outs with the former employers, becoming freelancer warriors for hire. Dangerous jobs like exploring old ruins, clearing out mutant infestations, and bounty hunting are second nature for a [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)\|Ronin (Fighter)]], not all that different from the life they left behind. The freedom to choose how they risk their lives is often worth it to [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)\|Ronin (Fighter)]] who abandoned the stifling strictures of the corporate hierarchy.

#### Second Wind

You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your ronin level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

#### Action Surge

Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

#### Martial Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose one of the Martial Archetypes detailed at the end of this class. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

You can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

#### Martial Versatility

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature (as detailed above), you can do one of the following, as you shift the focus of your martial practice:

· Replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to ronin.

· If you know any maneuvers from the Tactician archetype, you can replace one maneuver you know with a different maneuver.

#### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.

#### Indomitable

Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.
