## “It’s the one you don’t hear that gets you.”

[[Classes/Ronin/Martial Archetypes (Subclasses)/Tactical Sniper (Arcane Archer)\|Snipers]] are feared and despised by their enemies in a measure as equal as they are revered by their allies. It’s hard not to hate someone whose job description is killing you before you ever know you’re there, and it’s just as hard to avoid being awed when you get saved by someone you never even saw. [[Classes/Ronin/Martial Archetypes (Subclasses)/Tactical Sniper (Arcane Archer)\|Tactical snipers]] are a similar breed to their longer-distance brethren, being somewhat closer and more personal than those angels of death. They are still masters of [[longarms\|longarms]] and using [[tech-enhanced bullets\|tech-enhanced bullets]] to bring down the biggest of prey.

#### Basic Tech
At 3rd level, you learn some basic tech abilities, as well as gaining knowledge of either wilderness survival or the theory behind your advanced capabilities. You choose to gain proficiency in either the Technology or Survival skill, and you choose to learn either the [[nanotech twiddling\|nanotech twiddling]] or [[druidcraft trick\|druidcraft trick]].

#### Trick Shot
At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special tech effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Trick Shot options of your choice.

Once per turn when you fire bullet from a [[firearm\|firearm]] without the loading quality as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Trick Shot options to that bullet. You decide to use the option when the bullet hits, unless the option doesn’t involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain an additional Trick Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level [[[Ronin\|[Ronin]].

#### Tech Shot
At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse bullets with enhanced power. Whenever you fire a mundane bullet from a [[firearm\|firearm]] without the loading property, you can make it tech for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to mundane attacks and damage. The power fades from the bullet immediately after it hits or misses its target.

> [!info] Magic Bullet
> At 7th level, you learn how to direct a bullet arrow toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with a tech bullet and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.

> [!info] Ever-Ready Shot
> Starting at 15th level, your empowered gunplay is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Trick Shot remaining, you regain one use of it.

> [!info] Trick Shot Options
> The Trick Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. They are all tech effects, as though the shot were enhanced by a trick-level tech.
>
> If an option requires a saving throw, your Trick Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

> [!info] Banishing Bullet. 
> You use engrammatic tech to try to temporarily digitize your target, rendering them briefly nonexistent. The creature hit by the bullet must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, its speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
> 
> After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 2d6 kinetic damage when the bullet hits it.

> [!info] Beguiling Bullet. 
> Your neural-override tech causes this bullet to temporarily confuse its target into believing that one of your friends is their friend. The creature hit by the bullet takes an extra 2d6 software damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.
> 
> The software damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

> [!info] Bursting Bullet. 
> You imbue your bullet with incredible potential energy. The bullet detonates after your attack. Immediately after the bullet hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 kinetic damage each.
> 
> The kinetic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

> [!info] Entropic Bullet. 
> Your bullet is filled with highly destructive nanites. The creature hit by the bullet takes an extra 2d6 entropic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.
>
> The entropic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

> [!info] Flare Bullet. 
> You infuse your bullet with burning phosphorus, causing it to blind and terrify your foe. The creature hit by the bullet takes an extra 2d6 software damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.
>
> The software damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

> [!info] Goo Bullet. 
> When this bullet strikes its target, copious amounts of crowd-control foam bursts from it, ensnaring the target. The creature hit by the bullet takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the goo with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Trick Shot save DC. Otherwise, the goo lasts for 1 minute or until you use this option again.
>
> The poison damage and bludgeoning damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

> [!info] Piercing Bullet. 
> You briefly set your bullet out of quantum phase with reality. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the bullet fires forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The bullet passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the bullet, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.
>
> The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

> [!info] Seeking Bullet. 
> Using advanced predictive algorithms, you grant your bullet the ability to seek out your target, allowing the bullet to curve and twist its path in search of its prey. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The bullet flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon’s range and there is a path large enough for the bullet to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the bullet, plus an extra 1d6 kinetic damage, and you learn the target’s current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don’t learn its location.

> The kinetic damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.
