## “I’ve done unspeakable things for ungrateful assholes. Imagine what I’m capable of doing for someone I actually like.”
<sub>As Seen on [SlimWiki](https://slimwiki.com/carbon-pink/public-wiki-w-knoldiw/special-operative) and [5E Psi Warrior](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:psi-warrior)!</sub>

Filled to the brim with cutting-edge [[implants\|implants]] and [[gene-mods\|gene-mods]], special operatives use their unique talents to overcome challenges. Their internal wellspring of power—a series of biokinetic batteries—lets them generate destructive discharges of energy through their [[Weapons\|Weapons]], manifest force fields, and otherwise alter the world around them in ways that defy ordinary physics.


#### Biokinetic Power
At 3rd level, you are implanted with a series of hyper-dense batteries that grant you a special energy resource. This energy is represented by your Biokinetic Energy dice, which are each a d6. You have a number of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and they fuel various powers you have, which are detailed below.

Some of your powers expend the Biokinetic Energy die they use, as specified in a power’s description, and you can’t use a power if it requires you to use a die when your dice are all expended. You regain all your expended Biokinetic Energy dice when you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Biokinetic Energy die, but you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Biokinetic Energy dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).


##### The powers below use your Biokinetic Energy dice.
> [!info] Protective Field. 
> When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend one Biokinetic Energy die, roll the die, and reduce the damage taken by the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum reduction of 1), as you create a momentary shield of telekinetic force.

> [!info] Power Strike. 
> You can propel your [[Weapons\|Weapons]] with kinetic force. Once on each of your turns, immediately after you hit a target within 30 feet of you with an attack and deal damage to it with a [[Weapons\|weapon]], you can expend one Biokinetic Energy die, rolling it and dealing kinetic damage to the target equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier.

> [!info] Telekinetic Movement. 
> You can move an object or a creature with your mind. As an action, you target one loose object that is Large or smaller or one willing creature, other than yourself. If you can see the target and it is within 30 feet of you, you can move it up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, if it is a Tiny object, you can move it to or from your hand. Either way, you can move the target horizontally, vertically, or both. Once you take this action, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend a Biokinetic Energy die to take it again.


#### Biokinetic Adept
By 7th level, you have mastered new ways to use your biokinetic abilities, detailed below.

> [!info] Powered Leap. 
> As a bonus action, you can propel your body with your mind. You gain a flying speed equal to twice your walking speed until the end of the current turn. Once you take this bonus action, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend a Biokinetic Energy die to take it again.

> [!info] Telekinetic Thrust. 
> When you deal damage to a target with your Power Strike, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. If the save fails, you can knock the target prone or move it up to 10 feet in any direction horizontally.


#### Guarded Mind
Starting at 10th level, the Biokinetic Energy flowing through you has bolstered your mind. You have resistance to [[software damage\|software damage]]. Moreover, if you start your turn charmed or frightened, you can expend a Biokinetic Energy die and end every effect on yourself subjecting you to those conditions.


#### Force Field
At 15th level, you can shield yourself and others with biokinetic force. As a bonus action, you can choose creatures, which can include you, that you can see within 30 feet of you, up to a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of the chosen creatures is protected by [[half cover\|half cover]] for 1 minute or until you’re incapacitated.

Once you take this bonus action, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a Biokinetic Energy die to take it again.


#### Biokinetic Master
By 18th level, your ability to move creatures and objects with your mind is matched by few. You can cast the [[telekinesis tech\|telekinesis tech]], requiring no components, and your techcasting ability for the tech is Intelligence. On each of your turns while you concentrate on the tech, including the turn when you cast it, you can make one attack with a [[Weapons\|weapon]] as a bonus action.

Once you cast the tech with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a Biokinetic Energy die to cast it again.
