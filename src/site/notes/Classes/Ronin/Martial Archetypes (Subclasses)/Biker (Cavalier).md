Bikers are warriors who excel at vehicular combat. Though the vast majority of them use motorcycles—as the name alludes—some also drive other vehicles. The only requirement for a biker is that their vehicle be fast and maneuverable. Beyond that, everything else is negotiable. The archetypal image of a biker in the modern world is one of a gang member who protects “his people” at any cost, so many bikers also excel at defending the people in their care.


#### Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. You also gain proficiency with either motorcycles or muscle cars. If you were already proficient with the chosen vehicle, you instead gain expertise.


#### Creature of the Wheel
Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a driver becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid wrecking your vehicle. If you wreck your vehicle, you suffer only half damage and are not Stunned by the wreck.

Finally, getting into or out of a vehicle costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.


#### Unwavering Mark
Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a [[melee weapon\|melee weapon]] attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.

While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn’t target you.

In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special [[melee weapon\|melee weapon]] attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attack’s [[Weapons\|weapon]] deals extra damage to the target equal to half your [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)\|Ronin (Fighter)]] level.

Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum 1), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.


#### Warding Maneuver
At 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your vehicle, or other creatures nearby. If you, your vehicle, or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you’re wielding a [[melee weapon\|melee weapon]] or a [[shield\|shield]]. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target’s AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack’s damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.


#### Hold the Line
At 10th level, you become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the target’s speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.


#### Ferocious Charger
Starting at 15th level, you can run down your foes, whether you’re driving or not. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.


#### Vigilant Defender
Starting at 18th level, you respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature’s turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can’t use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.
