## “Welcome to the cutting edge of technology! Get it? Cutting edge? ...Ahh, fuck it, you’re gonna die anyway.”
<sub>As Seen on [SlimWiki](https://slimwiki.com/carbon-pink/public-wiki-w-knoldiw/techno-blade) and [5E Eldritch Knight](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:eldritch-knight)!</sub>

Though not all of them fight with swords, the term “techno-blade” is in vogue for those [[Ronin\|Ronin]] who give into their gearhead tendencies and delve the depths of technology to augment their combat capabilities. Though they will never be the equal of a true [[Techwizard\|Techwizard]], their battle-oriented [[techs\|techs]] can give them a deadly edge in combat.

#### Techcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast [[techs\|techs]].

#### Tricks
You learn two [[Tricks\|tricks]] of your choice from the [[Techwizard tech list\|Techwizard tech list]]. You learn an additional [[techwizard trick\|techwizard trick]] of your choice at 10th level.

#### Tech Slots
The [[Classes/Ronin/Martial Archetypes (Subclasses)/Techno-Blade (Eldritch Knight)#Techno-Blade Tech Use\|Techno-Blade Tech Use table]] shows how many [[tech\|tech]] slots you have to cast your [[techs\|techs]] of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these [[techs\|techs]], you must expend a slot of the tech’s level or higher. You regain all expended tech slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level [[tech emergency barrier\|tech emergency barrier]] and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level tech slot available, you can cast emergency barrier using either slot.

#### Techs Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know three [[1st-level Techwizard techs\|1st-level Techwizard techs]] of your choice, two of which you must choose from the [[Protection\|Protection]] and [[Altercation techs\|Altercation techs]] on the [[Techwizard tech list\|Techwizard tech list]].

The Techs Known column of the [[Classes/Ronin/Martial Archetypes (Subclasses)/Techno-Blade (Eldritch Knight)#Techno-Blade Tech Use\|Techno-Blade Tech Use table]] shows when you learn more [[Techwizard techs\|Techwizard techs]] of 1st level or higher. Each of these [[techs\|techs]] must be an [[Protection\|Protection]] or [[Altercation tech\|Altercation tech]] of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have tech slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new tech of 1st or 2nd level.

The techs you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any [[tech\|tech]] category.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the [[Techwizard techs\|Techwizard techs]] you know with another [[tech\|tech]] of your choice from the [[Techwizard tech list\|Techwizard tech list]]. The new [[tech\|tech]] must be of a level for which you have [[tech\|tech]] slots, and it must be an [[Protection\|Protection]] or [[Altercation tech\|Altercation tech]], unless you’re replacing the [[tech\|tech]] you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any [[tech\|tech]] category.

#### Techcasting Ability
Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your [[Techwizard techs\|Techwizard techs]], since you learn your [[techs\|techs]] through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a [[tech\|tech]] refers to your techcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a [[Techwizard tech\|Techwizard tech]] you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

· Tech save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

· Tech attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

#### Weapon Bond
At 3rd level, you learn how to upgrade one [[weapon\|weapon]] you own with [[tech\|tech]]. You perform the modification over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The [[weapon\|weapon]] must be within your reach throughout the process, at the conclusion of which you touch the [[weapon\|weapon]] and forge a biometric bond with it.

Once you have bonded a [[weapon\|weapon]] to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that [[weapon\|weapon]] unless you are incapacitated. You can summon that [[weapon\|weapon]] as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

You can have up to two biometrically bonded [[Equipment/Weapons\|weapons]], but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third [[weapon\|weapon]], you must break the bond with one of the other two.

#### Battle Synergy
Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a [[trick\|trick]], you can make one [[weapon\|weapon]] attack as a bonus action.

#### Techno-Strike
At 10th level, you learn how to make your [[weapon\|weapon]] strikes undercut a creature’s resistance to your [[techs\|techs]]. When you hit a creature with a [[weapon\|weapon]] attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a [[tech\|tech]] you cast before the end of your next turn.

#### Quantum Charge
At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)#Action Surge\|Action Surge]]. You can teleport before or after the additional action.

#### Improved Techno-Strike
Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a [[tech\|tech]], you can make one [[weapon\|weapon]] attack as a bonus action.
