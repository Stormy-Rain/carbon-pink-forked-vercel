## “The point of battle is not to die for your cause. It’s to make the other bastard die for his.”
<sub>As Seen on [SlimWiki](https://slimwiki.com/carbon-pink/public-wiki-w-knoldiw/tactician) and [5E Battle Master](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:battle-master)!</sub>

A [[Classes/Ronin/Martial Archetypes (Subclasses)/Tactician (Battle Master)\|tactician’s]] approach to battle is surgical in nature: assess the problem, analyze the best method for dealing with it, then ruthlessly cut until it’s removed. They are superior combatants who utilize martial techniques that are undreamed of by lesser warriors. These [[Ronin\|Ronin]] are often intellectual fighters, versed in history and culture as well as the arts of war. Not all of them absorb such lessons, but learning from the past and present can be a surefire signifier of victory in the future.

#### Combat Superiority
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

#### Maneuvers. 
You learn three maneuvers of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

#### Superiority Dice. 
You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

#### Saving Throws. 
Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

· Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

#### Student of Battle
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of tool kit of your choice, or with the Culture or History skill.

#### Know Your Enemy
Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:

· Strength score
· Dexterity score
· Constitution score
· Armor Class
· Current hit points
· Total class levels, if any
· Ronin class levels, if any

#### Improved Combat Superiority
At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.

##### Relentless
Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.

#### Maneuvers
The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.
