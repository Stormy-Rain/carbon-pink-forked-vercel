## “The only thing better than me is two of me.”

[5E Echo Knight](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/)

Using hardlight projectors, tasked nanoswarms, and intense mental discipline, some [[Ronin\|Ronin]] learn how to manifest holographic copies of themselves that fight alongside them in battle. A hardlight warrior’s “echo” isn’t a real person, but the level of intelligence and discretion it shows in a fight is well past that of a mere drone or combat robot. In most ways, the echo is a full copy of the warrior, albeit one that can only be created in the heat of combat.

Manifest Echo

At 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to manifest an echo of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This echo is a tech-based, translucent image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another echo, or until you’re incapacitated.

Your echo has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the echo to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your echo is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.

As a bonus action, you can teleport, swapping places with your echo at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.

When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the echo’s space. You make this choice for each attack.

When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your echo moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the echo’s space.

Unleash Incarnation

At 3rd level, you can heighten your echo’s fury. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can make one additional melee attack from the echo’s position.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Echo Avatar

Starting at 7th level, you can mentally commune with your echo directly. As an action, you can see through your echo’s eyes and hear through its ears. During this time, you are deafened and blinded. You can sustain this effect for up to 10 minutes, and you can end it at any time (requires no action). While your echo is being used in this way, it can be up to 1,000 feet away from you without being destroyed.

Hardlight Martyr

Starting at 10th level, you can make your echo throw itself in front of an attack directed at another creature that you can see. Before the attack roll is made, you can use your reaction to teleport the echo to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the targeted creature. The attack roll that triggered the reaction is instead made against your echo.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Reclaim Potential

By 15th level, you’ve learned to absorb the potential energy of your echo. When an echo of yours is destroyed by taking damage, you can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Constitution modifier, provided you don’t already have temporary hit points.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Legion of One

At 18th level, you can use a bonus action to create two echos with your Manifest Echo feature, and these echoes can co-exist. If you try to create a third echo, the previous two echoes are destroyed. Anything you can do from one echo’s position can be done from the other’s instead.

In addition, when you roll initiative and have no uses of your Unleash Incarnation feature left, you regain one use of that feature.
