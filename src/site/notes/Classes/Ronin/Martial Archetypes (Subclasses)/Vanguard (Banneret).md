## “Once more into the breach!”
<sub>As Seen on [SlimWiki](https://slimwiki.com/carbon-pink/public-wiki-w-knoldiw/vanguard) and [5E Banneret](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:banneret)!</sub>

[[Classes/Ronin/Martial Archetypes (Subclasses)/Vanguard (Banneret)\|Vanguards]] are warriors who inspire greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. A lone [[Classes/Ronin/Martial Archetypes (Subclasses)/Vanguard (Banneret)\|Vanguard]] is still a skilled combatant, but one leading a band of allies can turn even the most poorly trained street scum into a well-oiled machine. Their “lead from the front” attitude can get them into trouble at times, but it also inspires incredible loyalty from their followers.

#### Rallying Cry
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries.

When you use your [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)#Second Wind\|Second Wind]] feature, you can choose up to three creatures within 60 feet of you that are allied with you. Each one regains hit points equal to your [[Ronin\|Ronin]] level, provided that the creature can see or hear you.

#### Royal Envoy
Leaders are expected to have some level of diplomatic ability, no matter how rough around the edges they might be normally.

At 7th level, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill. If you are already proficient in it, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Insight, Intimidation, or Performance.

Whether you gained proficiency in the Persuasion skill from this ability or previously, you roll Persuasion checks with expertise.

#### Inspiring Surge
Starting at 10th level, when you use your [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)#Action Surge\|Action Surge]] feature, you can choose one creature within 60 feet of you that is allied with you. That creature can make one [[melee\|melee]] or [[ranged weapon\|ranged weapon]] attack with its reaction, provided that it can see or hear you.

Starting at 18th level, you can choose two allies within 60 feet of you, rather than one.

#### Bulwark
Beginning at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of your [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)#Indomitable\|Indomitable]] feature to an ally. When you decide to use [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)#Indomitable\|Indomitable]] to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw and you aren’t incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.
