Codebreakers enhance their martial prowess with bits and pieces of the Old Web, programming code that predates the New World and which hold the building blocks of all modern computing and genetic engineering. By utilizing these special codes in their [[Equipment/Weapons\|weapons]], [[implants\|implants]], and [[loot#peripherals\|peripherals]], codebreakers tap into a technological power that the corporations would love to suppress—or control.  

#### Bonus Proficiencies

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with programmer’s tools.

#### Code Fragments

Starting at 3rd level, you can use fragments of ancient code to enhance your gear. You learn two codes of your choice, from among the codes described below, and each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one code you know with a different one from this feature. When you reach certain levels in this class, you learn additional codes, as shown in the Codes Known table.

#### Codes Known
| [[Classes/Ronin/Ronin (Fighter)\|Ronin]] Level | Number of Codes |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd lvl | 2 |
| 7th lvl | 3 |
| 10th lvl | 4 |
| 15th lvl | 5 |

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to the number of codes you know, and you insert a different code fragment into each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a [[Equipment/Weapons\|weapon]], a [[Equipment/Armor\|suit of armor]], a [[shield\|shield]], a piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear or hold in a hand. Your code remains in an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your codes at a time.

The following codes are available to you when you learn a code. If a code has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the code. If a code requires a saving throw, your save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

#### Cloaking Code. 
While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this code, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.

In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the code and choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This effect can transfer the attack’s effects regardless of the attack’s range. Once you invoke this code, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Delver’s Code. 
While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this code, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the code and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this code, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Icebox Code. 
While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this code, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

In addition, you can invoke the code as a bonus action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or Constitution. Once you invoke this code, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Maker’s Code. 
While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this code, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a [[Equipment/Weapons\|weapon]], you can invoke the code to summon electrified shackles: the target takes an extra 2d6 lightning damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 lightning damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this code, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Predictive Code (7th Level or Higher). 
While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this code, you have advantage on Intelligence (Technology) checks, and you can’t be surprised as long as you aren’t incapacitated.

In addition, you can invoke the code as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you’re incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke this code, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Titan Code (7th Level or Higher). 
While wearing or carrying an object that bears this code, you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance against poison damage.

In addition, you can invoke the code as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke this code, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.


#### Hulk Out

At 3rd level, you have learned how to briefly alter your own genetic code to become a hulking monster. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits, which last for 1 minute:

> [!info]
> · If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn’t change.
> 
> · You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
> 
> · Once on each of your turns, one of your attacks with a [[Equipment/Weapons\|weapon]] or an unarmed strike can deal an extra 1d6 damage to a target on a hit.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### Short Circuit

At 7th level, you learn to invoke your code fragments to protect your allies. When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll the d20 and use the new roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Great Stature

By 10th level, your mastery of your own genetic code permanently alters you. When you gain this feature, roll 3d4. You grow a number of inches in height equal to the roll. You permanently gain the Powerful Build quality, allowing you to count as one size larger than your actual size for purposes of carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

Moreover, the extra damage you deal with your Hulk Out feature increases to 1d8.

#### Code Master

At 15th level, you can invoke each code you know from your Code Fragments feature twice, rather than once, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Truly Massive

At 18th level, you learn how to amplify your genetic transformation. As a result, the extra damage you deal with the Hulk Out feature increases to 1d10. Moreover, when you use that feature, your size can increase to Huge, and while you are that size, your reach increases by 5 feet.
