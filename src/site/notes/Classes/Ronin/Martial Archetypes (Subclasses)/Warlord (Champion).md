## “Honorable men die hard, but they still die. It’s the real bastards who survive and conquer. Fighting isn’t about who’s right—it’s about who’s left.”

A [[Classes/Ronin/Martial Archetypes (Subclasses)/Warlord (Champion)\|warlord]] is the ultimate survivor, a brutal warrior who relies on raw power and deadly precision to carry the day. They combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows. Where other [[Ronin\|Ronin]] use fancy techniques, augment themselves with tech, dally in body modification, or rely on their allies, a [[Classes/Ronin/Martial Archetypes (Subclasses)/Warlord (Champion)\|warlord]] lets their skill speak for itself.
